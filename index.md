This project uses Python to examine text data from comments on YouTube and the specifications of the videos. The process involved collecting data from YouTube, cleaning and preprocessing it, and conducting sentiment and emoji analysis. The analysis yielded insights into frequently used words and emojis in user comments. Additionally, the project examined YouTube video details to identify trends and correlations between specific parameters such as likes, comments, views, video category, and the impact of punctuation on views. The findings indicated that the Music category receives the most likes, and positive words like "best" and "awesome" are common in user comments. The project concludes by highlighting limitations and areas for further investigation. 
I would like to thank Azadeh Irani for being an amazing colleague with whom I worked on the joint project.

<br>
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus, has had a massive impact on the world. The COVID-19 dataset provides us with valuable data that can be used to understand the spread and impact of the pandemic. In this analysis, we use SQL to analyze the COVID-19 dataset and gain insights into the pandemic's effect on different countries and regions.
